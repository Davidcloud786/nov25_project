Additional Considerations:

If you go with Option 1, make sure to have:

Documentation from your civilian employer confirming that you will return to work and your pay will resume after the five months.

Proof of military income to show the lender you have some income coming in during the gap.

Consider having a strong savings buffer to cover any gap in payments while you're away.
